## The Meaning of Finance

(Cross-Sectional Perspective)
Finance – Combination of Funds and Circulation
Involves transactions of funds, necessitating both suppliers and demanders of funds.

Finance derived from Fin (to end, conclude).

## Leverage Effect

When one's own strength is insufficient to lift an object, tools or methods are used to gain assistance.
Example: Even with a great business plan, an individual might lack sufficient capital. In such cases, external borrowing is employed to achieve business objectives.

Finance - External Capital = Leverage

(Longitudinal Perspective)

Efficiently allocating scarce financial resources over time, adapting to the progression of time.

(Allocation over time) – Spans across time.

Encounters disparities between income and expenditure.

For instance, when income is insufficient to meet consumption needs, finance provides a solution.

(Financial resources available to an individual throughout their lifetime are scarce.)

There exists a graph of income and consumption over a certain period of time.

Graph 1

A, B, C: Periods of disparity

A, C: Consumption exceeds income B: Income covers consumption and leaves surplus

From B, surplus cash flow is transferred to periods A and C as a contingency.

Graph 2

t=0 Present. t=1 Point at which financial transactions between fund suppliers and fund demanders expire.

Cross-Sectional Perspective:

Surplus funds from fund suppliers can address the financial shortage of fund demanders.

Longitudinal Perspective:

Allocating scarce future financial resources to the present day.

The meaning of finance: Costs and benefits of financial decisions are dispersed over time.

Example: Lending 1 million won -> Receiving 1.05 million won after one year.

Finance involves inherent risks.

Risk: Economic uncertainty with significant implications (issues with timely repayment of money).

Leverage Effect: (Investment effect achievable through externally borrowed funds or specialized contract structures.)

Example: Asset worth 100 million won - Anticipating a 50% increase in value after one year, borrowing 50 million won to invest. After one year, repaying the debt with 150 million won, achieving a 100% profit.
